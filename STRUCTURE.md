## Database Models

### Key Model Relationships

All database relationships are carefully designed with proper cascade behavior to ensure data integrity:

#### User
- Stores authentication information
- Uses secure password hashing
- Provides authentication methods

#### Employee
- Has many timesheets (one-to-many)
- Has many payroll payments (one-to-many)
- Enforces validation for employee status changes

#### Project
- Has many timesheets (one-to-many)
- Has many materials (one-to-many)
- Has many expenses (one-to-many)
- Has many invoices (one-to-many)
- Includes properties for cost and profit calculations
- Features actual revenue property to calculate revenue from paid invoices
- Includes actual_net_profit property to calculate real profit (actual revenue minus costs)

#### Timesheet
- Belongs to an employee (many-to-one)
- Belongs to a project (many-to-one)
- Includes hour calculation properties with lunch break handling
- Validates that employee is active

#### Material
- Belongs to a project (many-to-one)
- Configured with cascade delete when project is deleted

#### Expense
- Can belong to a project (many-to-one, optional)
- Includes payment tracking fields

#### PayrollPayment
- Belongs to an employee (many-to-one)
- Records payment information and status

#### Invoice
- Belongs to a project (many-to-one)
- Includes payment tracking fields

## Test Structure

The test suite is organized to ensure comprehensive coverage:

### Unit Tests
- **`test_models.py`**: Tests individual model functionality
- **`test_forms.py`**: Tests form validation rules

### Integration Tests
- **`test_routes.py`**: Tests route functionality
- **`test_integration.py`**: Tests multi-step workflows

### Complex Scenario Tests
- **`test_complex_scenarios.py`**: Tests business process flows
- **`test_edge_cases.py`**: Tests boundary conditions
- **`test_security_and_validation.py`**: Tests security features and validation

### Test Fixtures
- Provides sample data for testing
- Creates test environments with database isolation

## Configuration

The application uses Flask's configuration system:
- Development configuration is the default
- Session management for authentication
- Debug mode is enabled by default
- SQLite database used for simplicity
- Session security with SECRET_KEY
- CSRF protection enabled

## Security Features

- CSRF protection via Flask-WTF
- Input validation through WTForms
- Business rule enforcement in models
- Data integrity through SQLAlchemy relationships

## Recent Updates

### Models Updates
- **Timesheet**: Enhanced lunch break calculations
- **PayrollPayment**: Added fields for check tracking (check_number, bank_name)

### SQLAlchemy Updates
- Modernized all database access patterns to be SQLAlchemy 2.0 compatible
- Replaced `Model.query.get()` with `db.session.get(Model, id)`

- Eliminated deprecation warnings

### Reporting Enhancements
- Added comprehensive export functionality in three formats:

- Created reusable export helper functions:
  - `export_to_excel()`: Generates Excel spreadsheets
  - `export_to_pdf()`: Creates formatted PDF reports
  - `export_to_csv()`: Produces CSV files for data interchange
- Added dedicated export routes for each data type:
  - `/export/projects/<format>`
  - `/export/timesheets/<format>`
  - `/export/expenses/<format>`
  - `/export/invoices/<format>`
  - `/export/payroll/<format>`

### UI Updates
