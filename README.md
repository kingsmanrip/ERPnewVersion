## Recommended Workflow

### Initial Setup
1. Add employees through the Employees section
2. Create projects in the Projects section

### Daily Operations

3. Track business expenses

### Financial Management
1. Generate payroll reports and record payments to employees
2. Create invoices for completed projects

## Project Structure

- `app.py` - Main application file with routes and configuration
- `models.py` - Database models and relationships
- `forms.py` - Form definitions using WTForms
- `templates/` - HTML templates for the web interface
- `instance/` - Contains the SQLite database file
- `static/` - Static files (CSS, JavaScript)
- `tests/` - Comprehensive test suite

## Database Schema

The application uses the following main models:
- **Employee**: Stores employee information and pay rates
- **Project**: Manages project details, status, and relationships to other models
- **Timesheet**: Records work hours with automatic calculation of hours and lunch breaks
- **Material**: Tracks materials used in projects with costs
- **Expense**: Records business expenses with categorization
- **PayrollPayment**: Manages employee payment processing
- **Invoice**: Handles client billing for projects

## Key Model Relationships

All relationships are properly set up with cascade behavior for reliable data management:
- Projects have timesheets, materials, expenses, and invoices
- Employees have timesheets and payroll payments
- Proper validation ensures data integrity across all models

## Security Notes

This version includes basic user authentication. For enhanced security in production:
- Enable HTTPS for secure data transmission
- Implement role-based access control for different user types
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration (including SECRET_KEY)
- Store passwords using strong hashing methods (already implemented)
- Implement multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations
- Implement proper backup procedures for the database

## Troubleshooting

### Database Issues
- If you encounter database errors, check that the `instance` directory exists and has proper permissions
- For a fresh start, you can delete the database file in the `instance` directory and reinitialize it

### Port Already in Use
- If port 5000 is already in use, you can specify a different port:
  ```
  python app.py --port=5001
  ```

## Database Backup and Restore

This application includes an automated backup and restore system for the SQLite database.

### Automated Daily Backups

The system is configured to automatically create daily backups of the database at 3:00 AM:

- **Backup Location**: `/root/backups/erp/`
- **Backup Naming**: `erp_db_backup_YYYY-MM-DD.db.gz` (date-stamped and compressed)
- **Retention Policy**: Backups are kept for 30 days before being automatically deleted

### Database Restoration

To restore the database from a backup, use the provided restore script:

```bash
/root/restore_erp_db.sh YYYY-MM-DD
```

For example, to restore from April 3, 2025:
```bash
/root/restore_erp_db.sh 2025-04-03
```

The restore process:
1. Creates a safety backup of the current database
2. Stops the application service
3. Restores the selected backup
4. Restarts the application service

If no date is specified, the script will list all available backups.

### Manual Backup

To manually create a backup at any time, run:
```bash
/root/backup_erp_db.sh
```
